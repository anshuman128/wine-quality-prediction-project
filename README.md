# wine-quality-prediction-project using machine learning and python
Problem  Statement :  Wine quality is a crucial factor in the wine industry, affecting consumer preference and market value. Traditionally, wine quality is assessed through human sensory evaluation, which is subjective, time-consuming, and expensive. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict wine quality based on its chemical properties, such as acidity, alcohol content, pH levels, and sugar concentration.
The attributes commonly used in wine quality prediction are:Fixed Acidity : Fixed Acidity ,Volatile Acidity ,Citric Acid ,Residual Sugar , Free Sulfur Dioxid, pH, Sulphates.
Data analysis and visualization : NumPy , Pandas, Matplotlib, Python , Seaborn
